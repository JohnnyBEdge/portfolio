Project Overview
In order to promote yourself to potential employers as a web developer, it is crucial that you have a website that serves as a Portfolio. This Portfolio will showcase your abilities and your works. Beyond that, it will also present a means to contact you. It's a living resume of sorts that will grow and expand as your skills do.

This project is broken up into several phases, designed to follow along with the curriculum to help round out your education in particular subjects. Each phase is intended to be a foundation to build upon over time, again, just as your skills will grow over time. Essentially, expect to continue to work on your Portfolio throughout your career, both here in school, after graduation, and even after employment.

Phase Overview
In this phase, you will construct a simple HTML Portfolio and begin to flush out some of the primary content. Focus on the HTML you are writing, i.e., the syntax, clean code, proper use of appropriate tags. Create a document that contains information about you and your professional life.  Use a resume or something like a resume to convey the appropriate information.

Once completed, host this using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku. Leverage what is taught in class alongside your own research to host static content for free online.

Once the project is done, provide links to the hosted project and the GitHub URLs where your code lives.
